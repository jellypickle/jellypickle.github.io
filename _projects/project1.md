#Project Overview:

In order to understand how computers work with logic gates, our purpose was to build logic gates on breadboards. We first started off with the NOT, AND, OR gates. Later on, we collaborated with more teams in order to build NAND and XOR gates. It was one of my favorite projects throughout the entire semester! :D


#Technologies Used:

- Breadboards
- NPN transistors
- Resistors (330 Ohm and 2,000 Ohm)
- Jumper wires
- Push buttons
- LEDs
- Power supply module
