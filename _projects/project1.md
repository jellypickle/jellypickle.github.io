In order to understand how computers work with logic gates, our purpose was to build logic gates on breadboards. We first started off with the NOT, AND, OR gates. Later on, we collaborated with more teams in order to build NAND and XOR gates. It was one of my favorite projects throughout the entire semester! :D
