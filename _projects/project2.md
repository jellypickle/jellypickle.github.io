### Project Overview ###

Even though our destination to Gobustan was difficult, overall, our experience was pretty fun. When we went to the classroom and told them we will teach them simple programming, the students were very enthusiastic about it. After they completed all of the tasks in Bug Arena successfully, we gave out certificates; they were very happy about it and were very grateful for the experience we provided for them.
